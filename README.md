## Overview
Our project is a web application that:
1. Helps small businesses find portable air cleaners that will help them to keep their employees and customers safe from COVID-19.
2. Helps small businesses who either already have a portable air cleaner or found a portable air cleaner online and want to see if their portable air cleaner will ventilate their place of business well enough to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

Our application is based on [this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NEhk1IEdbEi_b3wa6gI_zNs8uBJjlSS-86d4b7bW098/edit#gid=1882881703) spreadsheet tool. The air quality calculations that we use are taken from this tool (more about these calculations below), but we have also added information not in this tool about recommended occupancy levels to try to specialize our project for small businesses. We used [this](https://www.governor.wa.gov/issues/issues/covid-19-resources/covid-19-reopening-guidance) resource from the Washington state governor's website to make our occupancy recommendations.

The application can be found [here](https://liamkokeeffe.github.io/Portable-Air-Cleaner-Calculator/#/).

### Architecture
We built our project with JavaScript and React.js.
All React components can be found in the `src/components` directory (except for the root `App.js` component which is in the `src` directory). We tried to name the components clearly and organize them into folders where it made sense.
* `src/components/LandingPage/LandingPage.js`: the page that a user first sees when visiting the website.
* `src/components/Calculator/CalculatorManager.js`: component that is responsible for saving the state of user inputs and passing this data between the calculator page (the page where users enter information about their room like its dimensions) and the results pages.
* `src/components/Calculator`: folder that contains other components used in the calculator page (input box where user enters their room dimensions is the `RoomDimensionsInput.js` component, etc.).
* `src/components/AirCleanerRecommendations`: folder that contains the components used on the air cleaner recommendations page (what the user sees if they are using or application to find an air cleaner and click "View results" on the calculator page).
* `src/components/RoomSizeRec`: folder that contains the component used on the "Test air cleaner" information page (what the user sees if they are using our application to test the quality of an air cleaner and click "View results" on the calculator page).
* `src/components/Layout`: folder that contains the application's header and footer components, as well as a layout component which specifies how these components are organized with regard to the "body" components (whatever components are between the header and footer). (Note: The `LanguageSelection` component is visually located in the header on wide screen views but it is located in the footer component in code).

### What air cleaners are being recommended?
Air cleaners being recommended are read from the csv file `src/air_cleaner_list.csv`. There is a [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13sPIFx85lZRDi4NUUka7anrnjawND3cdsc1KKrWKu-w/edit?usp=sharing) where the air cleaners and information about them are stored and updated. The air cleaners being recommended all have HEPA filters. When the Google Sheet changes, save the sheet as a csv file and then replace `src/air_cleaner_list.csv` with it (the change needs to then be deployed to take affect). Current air cleaners were chosen from the [existing tool](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NEhk1IEdbEi_b3wa6gI_zNs8uBJjlSS-86d4b7bW098/edit#gid=1882881703), the ConsumerLab.com article [Which air purifiers are best for reducing the spread of COVID-19?](https://www.consumerlab.com/answers/portable-air-cleaner/air-purifier/)</a>, and the California Air Resource Board's [List of CARB-Certified Air Cleaning Devices](https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/list-carb-certified-air-cleaning-devices).

**Note:** It is important that the column names are not changed in the Google Sheet. It is also important that the 
format of the data is kept consistent ($ symbols should not be added to the Price column as the other values in the 
column contain only numbers, the Size column should always have values in the format 
of 'number "x" number "x" number', etc.). The CADR column is in units of feet<sup>3</sup>/minute.

### Calculations Used
**Terms Defined for the Calculations Below:**
* ACH: Air Changes Per Hour
* CADR: Clean Air Delivery Rate (units of feet<sup>3</sup>/minute)
* Room volume is either in units of feet<sup>3</sup> or meters<sup>3</sup>
* Outdoor ventilation is in units of ACH
  - Poor: 1 ACH
  - Typical: 1.5 ACH
  - Good: 3 ACH
  - Enhanced: 4 ACH
* The 60 in the below calculation is in units of minute / hour.
* The 0.58 in the below calculation is in units of (hour * feet<sup>3</sup>)/(minute * meters<sup>3</sup>)

#### Air Cleaner Calculations
When **recommending air cleaners to users**, we take the user's entered room volume and level of outdoor ventilation to estimate the ACH that each air cleaner would give their room. We only recommend air cleaners with that would give the user's space an estimated ACH of 4 or more.


**If Units are Feet:**  
Estimated ACH of user's space = (((Air Cleaner's CADR) * 60 / Room Volume) * Number Of Air Cleaners Being Used) + Outdoor Ventilation  
**If Units are Meters:**  
Estimated ACH of user's space = (((Air Cleaner's CADR) / 0.58 / Room Volume) * Number Of Air Cleaners Being Used) + Outdoor Ventilation

When a user is **testing the effectiveness of an air cleaner**, users enter their room volume, level of outdoor ventilation, and the CADR of their air cleaner. We then use the same calculation that we use when recommending air cleaners, but this time the CADR value is provided by the user and we therefore only need to perform the calculation once. The user is then shown the estimated ACH that their air cleaner is giving/would give their space based on their inputs.

When a user is testing the effectiveness of an air cleaner, we also show them the **recommended room size** for their air cleaner (we only show this information if only one air cleaner is being tested and not multiple).

**If Units are Feet:** 

Recommended room size of an air cleaner (square feet) = (Air Cleaner's CADR + (Outdoor Ventilation * Room Volume (cubic feet) / 60)) * 60 / (5 * ceiling height (feet)).

**If Units are Meters:** 

Recommended room size of an air cleaner (square meters) = ((Air Cleaner's CADR + (Outdoor Ventilation * Room Volume (cubic meters) * 35.3147 / 60)) * 60 / 35.315) / (5 * ceiling height (meters)).</p>

**Note:** We round down to the nearest integer room size (so if the calculation gives 200.9 we show the user 200).

#### Occupancy Recommendation Calculations:
We based our occupancy recommendations based off the State of Washington's Healthy Washington â€“ [Roadmap to Recovery Plan](https://www.governor.wa.gov/issues/issues/covid-19-resources/covid-19-reopening-guidance) Guidelines. A JSON file is located at `/src/phase_date.json` which contains the phase occupancy guideline data for each event/business.  

**Data Format:**  
```
{
  "name" : <Name of the Event>,
  "phase1MaxPercentOccupancy" : <Max Percent Occupancy at Phase 1>,
  "phase2MaxPercentOccupancy" : <Max Percent Occupancy at Phase 2>,
  "phase3MaxPercentOccupancy" : <Max Percent Occupancy at Phase 3>,
  "phase1MaxOccupancy" : <Max Number of People Allowed at Phase 1>,
  "phase2MaxOccupancy" : <Max Number of People Allowed at Phase 2>,
  "phase3MaxOccupancy" : <Max Number of People Allowed at Phase 3>,
}
```
First, we take the phase (or max percent occupancy if the user entered that instead of their phase) and room type the user entered and find the corresponding recommended percent occupancy and max number of people allowed at that phase from the JSON file. Then, we take their building's **max occupancy** limit and multiply that by the recommended phase **percent occupancy** (Maximum Occupancy of Room * Current Phase Percent Occupancy). We then compare that value to the max number of people allowed at that phase and recommend whichever value is **smaller**.

**The occupancy information does not affect the ACH/air quality calculations.** Users do not need to enter their 
occupancy information to use the tool. If a user does enter their occupancy information and their room is more 
densely populated than the current occupancy limits, we just inform the user that this is the case.

### Running the application locally

You will need to have `npm` installed. You can install it [here](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm). Once npm is installed, you can run `npm install` in the project directory to install required dependencies for the project. Finally, run `npm start` to run the app. You will be able to view it at http://localhost:3000 in your browser.  

### Running tests

Run `npm test -- fileName.test.js` to run a test file. The different test files conflict when being run so they need to be run individually and the code in the test files not currently being run needs to be commented.  We used [react-testing-library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) to create our tests. The tests ensure any calculations we use work as expected and also user interaction like filtering/sorting works as expected.
